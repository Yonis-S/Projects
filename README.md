# WELCOME TO MY PAGE OF MY PROJECTS
Hello my name is Yonis Salah! This is my Repository where I will frequently be updating and working on new Computer Science related Projects for Resume. Most of my projects that I have been working with utilizes the C++ language. Here is a reference for what I can accomplish and code indivdually. Feel free to search through any of my works!!

Blackjack Program:
This code serves as a basic blueprint for calculating Blackjack hand scores and can be a foundation for building a more comprehensive Blackjack game. Program implements complex logic, conditional statements, loops, different return types, exception handling, and function parameters for card determination and scoring in order to obtain the correct output.

Inventory Program: 
Vector program that helps us manipulate through vectors, add to inventory as well as remove from our inventory. Program that utilizes vectors and their operations, including push and pop, objects, alongside conditional statements, loops, exception handling, const, and display of items as needed.

Tabs Program: 
Utilizes doubly linked list to move back and forth through nodes that we have produced. Also implements pointers such as previous and next as well as includes a head and tail for convenience. Program uses constructors, classes, complex design, loops, objects, conditional statements, doubly linked list,different return types to help us determine which tab we are on and our history of tabs as well as how to delete a on as well.

Library Program: 
Program that provides a design of a digital library, allowing users to interact with a collection of books by adding, deleting, finding, and displaying them. The operations that are implemented throughout this digital library program includes conditional statements, loops, different return types, exception handling, find command, as well as thoughtful logic.
